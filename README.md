# Weather_app

I have worked on project as Web Developer for WEATHER APP. I made a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this weather app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather data based on user input. The interface allows users to enter a city name for immediate weather updates, including current conditions and temperature and other weather related data. The project showcases streamlined frontend development and efficient API integration for a brief and effective weather experience and weather data.
